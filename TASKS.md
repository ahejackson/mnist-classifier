1. The Network Class
* Develop a network class in python
* Store the weights
* Calculate the output by forward propagation
* Test with simple logical function networks.

Eg. network.calculate(x)

2. The data
* Read MNIST data
* Unroll images into a single vector

3. More network
* initialise with random inputs
* implment backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent

4. Try it
